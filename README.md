In this project we'll program the bill dispenser subsystem for an ATM, considering that the customer can request withdraws amounts with dollar-precision and the availability of the bills.

A customer will enter the amount of money they want to withdraw from their account, and we need to write the program that will select which bills, 
and how many of each bill to give the user back, always optimizing by using the bills of largest denomination.

The bills available are: $500, $100, $50, $25, $10, $5, $1.
The availability of each bill will be given in a form of dictionary in our input data for the function.
